The following project presents the evaluation task.
In order to run the project, both the frontend and the backend is neccesarry to follow the instructions.

First of all, I recommend you to use Visual Studio 2022 to run this project.

Once the project has been downloaded, into Visual Studio 2022 is neccessarry to clean and build the project.
